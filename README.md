# Stacks

[![ci status][gh-action-badge]][gh-action-url] [![npm version][npm-badge]][npm-url]

Stacks is Stack Overflow’s design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces and workflows that conform to Stack Overflow’s principles, design language, and best practices.

Our documentation is built with Stacks itself, using its [immutable, atomic classes](http://johnpolacek.com/rethinking/) and components.

The Stacks website documents:

### Product
- Semantic and accessible component markup
- Cross-browser compatible Less / CSS
- An [icon library](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks-Icons)

### Email
- Email templates & components

Stacks documentation can be found at https://stackoverflow.design/

### Unit/Component Tests

Unit/Component tests are written with [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro).
Please follow the library's principles and documentation to write tests.

Stacks uses [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) and [Playwright](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/browser-launchers/playwright/) to run tests in a real browser context.

Execute the unit/component tests suite by running:
```sh
npm run test:unit
```
or if you prefer watch mode run:
```sh
npm run test:unit:watch
```

### Visual Regression Tests

**Prerequisites:** 
- `git lfs` ([installation docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage))
- `docker` ([installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- `pwsh` ([Installation docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3))

This [Web Test Runner plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/test-runner-visual-regression) is used to run visual regression tests. [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro).
Visual regression tests end with this suffix `*.visual.test.ts`.

Execute the visual regression tests suite by running:
```sh
npm run test:visual
```

Update the visual baseline via:
```sh
npm run test:visual:update
```

Failing tests (including diffs) can be found under `screenshots/[browser]/failed/` folders.
