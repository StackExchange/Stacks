# Stacks

Stacks is Stack Overflow’s design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces and workflows that conform to Stack Overflow’s principles, design language, and best practices.

Our documentation is built with Stacks itself, using its [immutable, atomic classes](http://johnpolacek.com/rethinking/) and components.

The Stacks website documents:

### Product
- Semantic and accessible component markup
- Cross-browser compatible Less / CSS
- An [icon library](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks-Icons)

### Email
- Email templates & components

Stacks documentation can be found at https://stackoverflow.design/

## Using Stacks
Using Stacks is outlined in our [usage guidelines](https://stackoverflow.design/product/guidelines/using-stacks).

## Building Stacks
To contribute to Stacks documentation or its CSS library, you’ll need to build Stacks locally. View our [building guidelines](https://stackoverflow.design/product/guidelines/building).

Having trouble getting these steps to work? Open [an issue](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/issues/new) with a `setup` label.

## Testing Stacks
Stacks has implemented visual regression testing with [Backstop](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS). To test if your new feature introduces visual regressions, run `npm run test` in a new Terminal window while Stacks is running. After the tests have run, a new browser window with any regressions will show. If the regressions are desired, you can run `npm run approve` to establish the new baseline.

Individual routes to test are found in [backstop.json](/backstop.json)
