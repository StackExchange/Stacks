# Stacks

Stacks is Stack Overflowâ€™s design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces and workflows that conform to Stack Overflowâ€™s principles, design language, and best practices.

Our documentation is built with Stacks itself, using its [immutable, atomic classes](http://johnpolacek.com/rethinking/) and components.

The Stacks website documents:

### Product
- Semantic and accessible component markup
- Cross-browser compatible Less / CSS
- An [icon library](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks-Icons)

### Email
- Email templates & components

Stacks documentation can be found at https://stackoverflow.design/

## Using Stacks
Using Stacks is outlined in our [usage guidelines](https://stackoverflow.design/product/guidelines/using-stacks).

## Building Stacks
To contribute to Stacks documentation or its CSS library, youâ€™ll need to build Stacks locally. View our [building guidelines](https://stackoverflow.design/product/guidelines/building).

## Testing Stacks

### Component Tests
ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

Component tests are written with [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro).
Please follow the library's principles and documentation to write tests.

Stacks uses [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) and [Playwright](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/browser-launchers/playwright/) to run tests in a real browser context

Execute the component tests suite via running:
```sh
npm test
```
or if you prefer watch mode run:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```

### Visual Regression Tests
ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This [Web Test Runner plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/test-runner-visual-regression) is used to run visual regression tests. [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro).
Visual regression tests end with this suffix `*.visual.test.ts`.

Execute the visual regression tests suite via running:
```sh
npm run test:visual
```

Update the visual baseline via:
```sh
npm run test:visual:update
```

Failing tests (including diffs) can be found under `screenshots/[browser]/failed/` folders.

### Visual Regression Tests (Legacy)
Stacks has implemented visual regression testing with [Backstop](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS). To test if your new feature introduces visual regressions, run `npm run test:regression` in a new Terminal window while Stacks is running. After the tests have run, a new browser window with any regressions will show. If the regressions are desired, you can run `npm run approve` to establish the new baseline.

Individual routes to test are found in [backstop.json](/backstop.json)
