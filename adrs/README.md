# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences. We strive to keep these records small and lean.

### Goal
We want to record important design decisions to help current and future contributors of the library to understand the reasons for doing things a certain way.


### Lightweight Process

- Create a new branch on this repository and copy `adrs/0000-template.md` to a new file with the next free number.
- Modify the template to add details about your proposal and add any supporting picture under the `adrs/images` folder.
- Make a Pull Request (PR) for your branch.
- Once consensus is reached and approvals given using the Github review system, the PR can be merged.

In case the team has already agreed on a decision and no further async discussion is necessary just go ahead an record it directly without opening any PR.


### Disclaimer

As of today, the primary audience for these ADRs artefacts is the Stacks Core Team. If circumnstances will change and we feel a broader audience should get involved in the decision making process we could look into evolving our process in something a bit more formal like the internal [Stack Overflow RFC process](https://github.com/StackEng/StackOverflow/blob/master/docs/rfcs/0001-lightweight-rfc-process.md).
