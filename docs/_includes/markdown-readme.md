# Stacks

Stacks is Stack Overflow’s design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces and workflows that conform to Stack Overflow’s principles, design language, and best practices.

Our documentation is built with Stacks itself, using its [immutable, atomic classes](http://johnpolacek.com/rethinking/) and components.

The Stacks website documents:

### Product

-   Semantic and accessible component markup
-   Cross-browser compatible Less / CSS
-   An [icon library](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks-Icons)
