    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>Questions, answers, and other types of Posts have <em>scores</em>.</li>
        <li>A post’s <em>score</em> is calculated by subtracting the total number of downvotes from the total number of upvotes.</li>
        <li>In almost all cases when referring to the sum of votes, we will use the term <em>score</em>.</li>
        <li>
            Use of the  term <em>votes</em> to refer to the post’s score is only acceptable in cases where we need to present the data in the format 
            <code>{ScoreValue} votes</code> (as is done in the <a href="/product/components/post-summary/">post summary component</a>). In this case, "votes" 
            stands in for the "balance of votes (up minus down)" on the post.
        </li>
        <li><em>Upvote</em> and <em>downvote</em> (one word, no hyphen) should be used when referring to the individual types of votes cast on a post.</li>
        <li>While the unit for score is obstensibly "points", use of this unit in reference to score or votes is not encouraged.</li>
