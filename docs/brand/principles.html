    {% header "h3", "Focused" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Designs should focus the person on what’s important at hand. Designs
        should focus on the central goal, pushing distractions and interruptions
        to the side until the stated goal is completed.
    </p>

    {% header "h3", "Welcoming" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Our designs shouldn’t feel “members only”, but inviting and
        approachable. Designs should be intentional and intuitive, not be some
        secret codex for users to decipher. While the subjects developers talk
        about may seem impersonal, our design approach shouldn’t be.
    </p>

    {% header "h3", "Purposeful" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Everything in its right place. Our designs might be packed with
        information, but everything should be purposeful. Don’t add extraneous
        data or ornamentation as it might distract people from the central goal
        at hand.
    </p>

    {% header "h3", "Five percent fun" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        We’re quirky, not corny. We enjoy the long joke. Our humor is dry and
        pops up in unexpected, but appropriate, places. We’re “business in
        front, party in the back.”
