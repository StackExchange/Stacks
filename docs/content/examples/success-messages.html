title: Success messages
description: It’s important that we keep users informed when actions are successfully completed. Success states throughout the user flow let users know that they’re either getting closer to achieving the goal, or have completed it.

        Before writing anything, make sure you know the answers to these questions:
    </p>
    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>How close is the user to achieving the intended goal?</li>
        <li>What does the user need to do next?</li>
        <li>Is this message likely to appear frequently or is it unique?</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "Be specific" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        A good success message provides clear information that the performed action was completed. It’s fine to let users know that what they did was successful, but even better to be specific about the action they took.
