    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Write for a 7th grade reading level. Stack Overflow users are busy people with limited time and attention. They’re also located all over the world with different levels of English fluency. You can help everyone follow along by choosing simple, consistent words and phrases, and being careful about jokes and cultural references.
    </p>
    {% header "h3", "Simple words" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">If there’s a simpler word to say what you mean, use it. Always choose the short, simple word over the long, complicated one. Don’t complicate your ideas with business or insider jargon. Only use jargon when you have reason to believe it will improve user understanding.</p>
