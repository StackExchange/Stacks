    {% header "h2", "Why do we have to write CSS inline?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        It’s still the safest way to ensure CSS styles are applied in email
        clients. Referencing external stylesheets isn’t well-supported in email.
        Embedded CSS in a <span class="stacks-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag
        <em>does</em> have decent support, and there are a few holdouts like

        and a

            target="_blank"
            >smattering of mostly non-US mobile clients</a
        >. Given Stack Overflow’s volume and reach, we choose to support as many
        email clients as we can, even ones that don’t support the
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag. So we opt for
        writing CSS inline, which is supported everywhere.

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "If CSS is inline, why do we need a style tag?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Inline CSS is a sure-fire way to style an email’s layout at a granular
        level. For the same reason it’s done on the web, adding a CSS reset to
        an email’s <span class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</span> helps to
        normalize how the code gets rendered in email clients that
        <a
            href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/style-element/style-in-head/"
            >support the <span class="stacks-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag</a
        >.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Each template contains a breakdown, element by element, of what each
        reset style is actually doing.
    </p>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "Can we use a CSS inliner?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        CSS inliners promise to take CSS written in the
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</span> and automatically move CSS
        <strong>inline</strong> in the appropriate locations in the
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;body&gt;</span>. However we
        <strong>recommend against</strong> using a CSS inliners with these
        templates. Here’s why:
    </p>
    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>These templates should not require a dependency to author CSS.</li>
        <li>
            The placement of the templates CSS is already optimized. The CSS in
            the <span class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</span> is meant only for
            email clients that parse CSS in this location. It doesn’t need to be
            inlined.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are some CSS selectors like
            <span class="stacks-code">:hover</span> that throw errors in some
            CSS inliners.
        </li>
        <li>
            Inlining leads to code bloat. Not only does this impact download
            speeds, but some email clients like Gmail and iOS Outlook truncate
            messages after they exceed a certain file size.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "How does CSS inheritance work in email?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Various email clients handle CSS inheritance differently from one
        another, so it’s best to place inline CSS on the HTML tag close to the
        content you wish to style instead of relying on the cascade.

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "How do margin and padding work in email?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Use <strong>margin</strong> block-level typography tags like
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;h&gt;</span>,
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;p&gt;</span>,
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;ul&gt;</span>, and
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;li&gt;</span>... and use
        <strong>padding</strong> on
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;td&gt;</span>s.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Outlook only honors margins on typography tags, and only honors padding
        on <span class="stacks-code">&lt;td&gt;</span> tags. Its interpretation
        of spacing on other tags like
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;table&gt;</span>,
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;div&gt;</span>, and
        <span class="stacks-code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tags is sketchy, so it’s
        best to avoid spacing with those.

        Use the HTML5 doctype

        shortest and easiest to remember, and it’s enough to trigger standards

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "What is preview text?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Preview text is a snippet of copy pulled in from the body of your email
        and typically displayed underneath the sender name and subject line in a
        subscriber’s inbox. It’s used to increase open rates, as users see an
        email in their inbox before opening it.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy ta-center">
        <img
            src="{{ '/assets/img/figure-preview-text.png' | relative_url }}"

            alt="Diagram of email subject line, sender, and preview text in mobile inbox"
            class="mx-auto wmx100"
        />
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Preview text is optional. If preview text is short or omitted, email
        clients will fill the space with text from the email body (including alt
        attributes). You can avoid unwanted text coming in from your email’s
        body by

            <strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Iterable</strong> inserts its own

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "How wide should an email be?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Our default email templates are
        <code class="stacks-code">680px</code> wide. Our hybrid math, the code
        that makes emails responsive without media queries, is built on that
        number.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        This is more a guideline than a rule. If the situation calls for it, an
        email can have any width. Examples might be...
    </p>
    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>
            <strong>One-off emails</strong> with unique layouts (like a major
            product update).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Single-column emails</strong> that don’t need to stack on
            small screens (like our Code of Conduct email).
        </li>
    </ul>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "What is conversation threading?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        When creating emails, Gmail may attempt to highlight portions of the
        email body that it thinks are important parts of a previous conversation
        thread. It does this by applying an
        <code class="stacks-code">.im</code> class to portions of the email,
        which makes text purple.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        To defend against this unwanted styling, our templates include a CSS
        reset in the <code class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</code>, though this
        will only be applied in
        <a

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "When should I deviate from these guidelines?" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        The template in this repo is not the only way to design HTML emails at
        Stack Overflow. It’s possible to deviate and create a custom design with
        new components. In fact, we’d encourage it for major announcements, big
        product updates, and anything that requires a more eye-catching email
        UX!
