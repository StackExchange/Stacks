    {% header h2 | Why do we have to write CSS inline? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        It’s still the safest way to ensure CSS styles are applied in email clients. Referencing external stylesheets isn’t well-supported in email. Embedded CSS in a <span class="stacks-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag <em>does</em> have decent support, there are a few hold outs like <a href="https://emails.hteumeuleu.com/trying-to-make-sense-of-gmail-css-support-after-the-2016-update-53c15151063a" target="_blank">a few Gmail clients</a> and a <a href="https://emails.hteumeuleu.com/should-we-stop-inlining-styles-in-emails-8c3b64f0d407" target="_blank">smattering of mostly non-US mobile clients</a>. Given Stack Overflow’s volume and reach, we choose to support as many email clients as we can, even ones that don’t support the <span class="stacks-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag. So we opt for writing CSS inline, which is supported everywhere.

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | If CSS is inline, why do we need a &lt;style&gt; tag? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Inline CSS is a sure fire way to style an email’s layout at a granular level. For the same reason it’s done on the web, adding a CSS reset to an email’s <span class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</span> helps to normalize how the code gets rendered in email clients that <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/style-element/style-in-head/">support the <span class="stacks-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Each template contains a breakdown, element by element, of what each reset style is actually doing.

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | How does CSS inheritance work in email? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Various email clients handle CSS inheritance differently from one another, so it’s best to place inline CSS on the HTML tag close to the content you wish to style instead of relying on the cascade.

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | How do margin and padding work in email? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Use <strong>margin</strong> block-level typography tags like <span class="stacks-code">&lt;h&gt;</span>, <span class="stacks-code">&lt;p&gt;</span>, <span class="stacks-code">&lt;ul&gt;</span>, and <span class="stacks-code">&lt;li&gt;</span>... and use <strong>padding</strong> on <span class="stacks-code">&lt;td&gt;</span>s.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Outlook only honors margins on typography tags, and only honors padding on <span class="stacks-code">&lt;td&gt;</span> tags. Its interpretation of spacing on other tags like <span class="stacks-code">&lt;table&gt;</span>, <span class="stacks-code">&lt;div&gt;</span>, and <span class="stacks-code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tags is sketchy, so it’s best to avoid spacing with those.

    {% header h2 | What is the best &lt;doctype&gt; for email? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Use the HTML5 doctype <code class="stacks-code">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>. It’s the shortest and easiest to remember, and it’s enough to trigger standards mode on supported clients. <a href="https://emails.hteumeuleu.com/which-doctype-should-you-use-in-html-emails-cd323fdb793c" target="_blank">This article</a> goes into more detail. There’s no need to close <code class="stacks-code">&lt;img&gt;</code> tags with trailing <code class="stacks-code">/</code> (XHTML style).

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | What is Preview Text? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Preview text is a snippet of copy pulled in from the body of your email and typically displayed underneath the sender name and subject line in a subscriber’s inbox. It’s used to increase open rates, as users see an email in their inbox before opening it.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        <img src="https://d31v04zdn5vmni.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ios-gmail-app-preview-text.jpg" alt="diagram of email subject line, sender, and preview text in mobile inbox" class="mx-auto w100 wmx6">
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Preview text is optional. If preview text is short or omitted, email clients will fill the space with text from the email body (including alt attributes). You can avoid unwanted text coming in from your email’s body by <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/the-little-known-preview-text-hack-you-may-want-to-use-in-every-email" target="_blank">using this hack</a>.

    {% header h2 | How wide should an email be? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Our default email templates are <code class="stacks-code">680px</code> wide. Our hybrid math, the code that makes emails responsive without media queries, is built on that number.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        This is more a guideline than a rule. It the situation calls for it, an email can have any width. Examples might be...
    </p>
    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li><strong>One-off emails</strong> with unique layouts (like a major product update).</li>
        <li><strong>Single-column emails</strong> that don’t need to stack on small screens (like our Code of Conduct email).</li>
    </ul>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | How should images be prepared? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Email has largely standardized on PNG, JPG, and GIF file formats. Animated GIFs are supported in all email clients, though Windows Outlook and Win10 Mail only display its first frame.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        SVG is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46783599/base64-encoded-image-is-not-showing-in-gmail/46789485#46789485">not well supported in most web email clients</a>, including Gmail (which accounts for most of our email opens) and are completely blocked in Outlook. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46783599/base64-encoded-image-is-not-showing-in-gmail/46789485#46789485">This includes base64 encoded images</a>.
    </p>
    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li><strong>Foreground images</strong> should be saved at @2x since they scale reliably in all major email clients. @2x images display crisply on high-definition displays when scaled down to @1x in code.</li>
        <li><strong>Background images</strong> should be saved at @1x since they don’t scale reliably in all major email clients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Ideally, images should be under ~100KB. Tools like <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac" target="_blank">Image Optim</a>, <a href="https://kraken.io/web-interface" target="_blank">Krackin</a>, and <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a> help bring down a file size. Keep in mind that animated GIFs tend to get very large, so it’s a good idea to keep them simple and use them sparingly.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Images should be hosted within their respective ESP. Upload images in Iterable for Iterable emails, add images in GitHub for StackMail emails, etc. Images should not be referenced using services like Imgur or Dropbox, as they have a greater chance of being marked as spam.

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | What is conversation threading? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        When creating emails, Gmail may attempt to highlight portions of the email body that it thinks are important parts of a previous conversation thread. It does this by applying an <code class="stacks-code">.im</code> class to portions of the email, which makes text purple.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        To defend against this unwanted styling, our templates include a CSS reset in the <code class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</code>, though this will only be applied in <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/style-element/style-in-head/">email clients that support CSS styles in the <code class="stacks-code">&lt;head&gt;</code></a>.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | When should I deviate from these guidelines? %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        The template in this repo is not the only way to design HTML emails at Stack Overflow. It’s possible to deviate and create a custom design with new components. In fact, we’d encourage it for major announcements, big product updates, and anything that requires a more eye-catching email UX! <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/" target="_blank">Really Good Emails</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=email+template" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> are good sources of design inspiration.
