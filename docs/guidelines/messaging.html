    <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-title mb8">Principles</h2>
    <p class="stacks-p _section mb32">When crafting messaging, keep the following principles in mind:</p>
    <dl class="grid gs16 fw-wrap fs-body2 lh-lg">
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Actionable</strong>,<br/><em>not idle</em></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Whenever possible, pair a message with an appropriate action(s) the user might use to remedy the situation. Remember every interaction is an opportunity to help the user with their goal(s).</strong></p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Informative</strong>,<br/><em>not verbose</em></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Say what you need to say and get out of the way. If further information is available, provide a link which the user can click to learn more.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Timely</strong>,<br/><em>not overwhelming</em></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Not every action requires a message, but when one does deliver the right message exactly when needed.</p></dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-title mb8">Types</h2>
    <p class="stacks-p _section mb32">Not all messages are equal. Depending on varying factors, a message could be delivered in a number of different ways. Regardless of the delivery method, all messages fall into one of these three types:</p>
    <dl class="grid gs16 fw-wrap fs-body2 lh-lg">
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>System</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">These are messages which originate from Stack Overflow, informing the user about some system-level issue or status. It's not a result of a user action. System messages should <strong>always be banners placed at the top of the page above all other content.</strong></p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Engagement</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">These are messages which originate from Stack Overflow, used to encourage specific user behavior or inform users about new features or product offerings. The manner in which these messages are delivered should graduate from subtle, inline prompts to site banners. The best delivery method should be determined based on the message, our business goals, and the perceived user importance.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Feedback</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">These are messages which originate from the user, alerting them on the status of an action they originated. These messages delivery methods range from inline copy to popovers to toast notifications. The best delivery method should be determined by the user's context, the message, our business goals, and the user's expected outcome.</p></dd>
    </dl>

<section class="stacks-section">
    <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-title mb8">Methods</h2>
    <p class="stacks-p _section mb32">Once you've identified your messaging type, figuring out <em>how</em> to deliver it becomes the hard part. There isn't a quick and easy answer here either. Multiple items must be considered when deciding on a delivery method, namely the message's importance, impact, timeliness, the behavior a user expects, and how actionable it is. Depending on these factors, a message could be delivered in multiple ways. This list outlines the possible methods, listing them from least to most intrusive.</p>
    <dl class="grid gs16 fw-wrap fs-body2 lh-lg">
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Inline Text</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">The least intrusive to the user's experience, the message sits within the content. This can be used with <strong>all</strong> messaging types. This message does not have an additional visual ornamentation or depth applied to it. It can be partnered with an illustration. An example of this would be an empty state.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Tooltips</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Used with <strong>Feedback</strong> messaging, tooltips are similar to popovers in that they float above a page's content. However, unlike popovers, tooltips are <em>informative only</em>.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Popovers</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Used with <strong>Engagement</strong> and <strong>Feedback</strong> messaging, popovers float above a page's content. They are <em>actionable</em>, <em>interactive</em>, and <em>informative</em>.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Toast</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Toasts deliver <strong>Feedback</strong> messaging. They inform the user about their action's outcome. They are <em>actionable</em>, <em>interactive</em>, and <em>timely</em>.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Notifications</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Notifications deliver <strong>System</strong> and <strong>Engagement</strong> messaging. These messages provide further information about items they relate to actions they have commited or are interested in staying informed about. They are <em>informative</em> and <em>timely</em>.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Notices</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Notices deliver <strong>System</strong> and <strong>Engagement</strong> messaging. They inform the user about statuses or possible actions. They are <em>informative</em> and <em>timely</em>. When needed they can also be <em>actionable</em>.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Banners</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Banners deliver <strong>System</strong> and <strong>Engagement</strong> messaging. While notices sit within the content area, banners sit above the main content area or above the website itself. They are <em>informative</em>, <em>timely</em>, and <em>actionable</em> whenever possible.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><strong>Heroes</strong></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Hero banners deliver <strong>Engagement</strong> messaging. These are larger banners which inform the user about new features or product changes. They are very invasive and so should be used sparingly. They must be <em>informative</em>, <em>timely</em>, and <em>actionable</em>.</p></dd>
        <dt class="grid--cell3"><p class="mb0"><a href="{{ "/components/modals" | relative_url }}">Modals</a></p></dt>
        <dd class="grid--cell9"><p class="mb16">Modals deliver <strong>Engagement</strong> and <strong>Feedback</strong> messaging. They are one of the most invasive messaging methods because they block interaction to the rest of the product until completed. They must be <em>informative</em>, <em>timely</em>, and <em>actionable</em>.</p></dd>
