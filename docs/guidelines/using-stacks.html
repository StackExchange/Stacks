  <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-h2">Goals</h2>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">Stacks is built with a unified goal: We should be writing <em>as little CSS as possible</em>. To achieve this goal, the Stacks team has created a robust set of reusable components. These include components like buttons, tables, and form elements.</p>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">We’ve also created a powerful set of atomic classes that can be chained together to create just about <em>any</em> layout without writing a single line of <em>new</em> CSS. Further, these atomic classes can be used as modifiers of pre-existing components.</p>

  <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-h2">How to best use Stacks</h2>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">In order to use Stacks, let’s consider the design you’d like to implement.</p>

  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg fw-bold">My design uses existing components</p>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">Identify if the design you’re implementing uses any existing components. Great, it does? Grab the markup from that component’s example page and paste that into your view.</p>

  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg fw-bold">My design uses existing components but has some special cases.</p>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg"><em>e.g. background colors, border, font sizes</em>. Awesome, copy the component’s example markup to your view and add a atomic class to override its styling. Practically, this will likely just be adding something like an <a href="{{ "/base/spacing" | relative_url }}"><code class="stacks-code">.mb12</code></a> to a button, or hiding something temporarily with <a href="{{ "/base/display" | relative_url }}"><code class="stacks-code">.d-none</code></a>.</p>

  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg fw-bold">My design uses a new pattern that doesn’t have a component yet.</h3>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">No worries, let’s build your view by assembling some atomic classes. If you’re doing this more than once, you should help us identify a new pattern by <a href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/issues/new">requesting a new component</a>.</p>

  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg fw-bold">My design is super special and…</p>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">I’m going to write a lot of custom CSS from scratch in its own <code class="stacks-code">.less</code> file that I’ve included in the bundle. You <em>probably</em> shouldn’t be doing this. With atomic classes, you can build <em>most</em> of what you’re attempting to do without writing a single new line of CSS. The Stacks team would prefer you use these pre-existing classes to build new UI. Every line of CSS you write, the more CSS we have to maintain, the more our users have to download, and the more bytes we have to host.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
  <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-h2" id="toc-javascript">What about Javascript?</h2>
  <p class="stacks-copy stacks-copy__lg">At this time Stacks is a pure Less/CSS framework and does not include any Javascript. The Javascript written for our examples is only used to demonstrate the component’s states. It is not meant to be used in production.</p>
