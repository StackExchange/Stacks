        Stops 500 and 600 can be used for text. Neutrals, blue, red, and green can also be used at 400 and will meet APCA contrast minimums within these shades. Orange and yellow should not be used at 400 because it does not meet our contrast standards.

        Colors in the neutral palette are layered on top of each other to foster a sense of hierarchy and create associations.

    {% header "h2", "Emphasis levels" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Emphasis determines the amount of contrast a color has against the default surface. Emphasis has a range from subtle to bold. Bold emphasis has more contrast against the background, which adds more attention than using UI with the subtle or default emphasis level.
    </p>

    {% header "h2", "Interaction states" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        In Stacks, a component will get darker (or lighter in dark mode) as they interact with it. These progresses happen by adding 100 to the color before the interaction happens. Example: Blue-400 on hover becomes Blue-500. For a disabled button state, subtract 100 from the default color.
    </p>
    <img class="wmx100" src="{{ "/assets/img/colors/interaction-button-example.png" | url }}" alt="Four buttons showing the visual differences between default, hover, selected, and disabled states." />

    <section class="stacks-section">
        {% header "h2", "Light, dark, and high contrast modes" %}
        <p class="stacks-copy">Stacks supports light, dark, and high contrast modes. By using Stacks, you will get each of these modes for free. By using a Stacks component, an atomic color class, or CSS variable directly, your theme will switch appropriately based on the following methods: </p>
        <ol class="stacks-list">
            <li>You can apply <code class="stacks-code">.theme-system</code> to the <code class="stacks-code">body</code> element. This will change colors based on the <code class="stacks-code">prefers-color-scheme</code> media query, which is ultimately powered by the user’s system or browser settings. This can be preferable for folks who have their system turn to dark mode based on ambient light or time of day.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can set a dark mode that is not system dependent by attaching <code class="stacks-code">.theme-dark</code> to the <code class="stacks-code">body</code> element.</li>
            <li>Adding <code class="stacks-code">.theme-highcontrast</code> to the <code class="stacks-code">body</code> element will boost colors to WCAG Level AAA contrast ratios in as many places as possible. This mode stacks on top of both light and dark modes. The only exception is branded themed colors remain untouched by high contrast mode.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="stacks-copy">There are also <a class="s-link" href="{{ "/product/guidelines/conditional-classes#dark-mode" | url }}">conditional classes</a> that can be applied to override assumed dark mode colors, force light mode, or to force dark mode. Forcing modes can be good for previews in admin-only situations.</p>
