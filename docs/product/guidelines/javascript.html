    {% header h2 | Including the Stacks JavaScript %}

    <p class="stacks-copy">While Stacks is first and foremost a CSS library, it also provides commonly used functionality for some components via JavaScript code. Using this functionality is optional. If you only need the styling parts of Stack, you’re free to ignore the provided JavaScript. The converse is not true: The JavaScript components work under the assumption that the Stacks CSS is available.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">In order to use the JavaScript components, do the following.</p>

    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>Include the file <code class="stacks-code">dist/js/stacks.min.js</code> in your page. For example, if you use the unpkg CDN, add the tag <code class="stacks-code">&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/@stackoverflow/stacks/dist/js/stacks.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to your HTML. See <a href="/product/guidelines/using-stacks">Using Stacks</a> for more information on unpkg.</li>

        <li>If you need to support Internet Explorer 11, you also have to include the file <code class="stacks-code">dist/js/stacks.polyfills.min.js</code>. This file has to be included before the main JavaScript file.</li>
    </ul>

    {% header h2 | Using the Stacks JavaScript %}

    <p class="stacks-copy">The Stacks JavaScript components are provided as Stimulus controllers. <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> is a library created by Basecamp (formerly 37Signals).</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Stimulus allows you to at functionality to your markup in a way that is similar to how you add styling to your markup: by modifying HTML attributes.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">You style components by adding classes to the <code class="stacks-code">class</code> attribute, ideally not having to write any custom CSS. Similarly, you give components functionality by adding <code class="stacks-code">data-...</code> attributes to the HTML, ideally not having to write any custom JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">The basic functional unit of Stimulus, and of a Stacks JavaScript component, is a <b>controller</b>. Controllers are identified by their name, and all Stacks-provided controller names are prefixed with <code class="stacks-code">s-...</code>, just like component CSS classes. You give functionality to an HTML element by setting its <code class="stacks-code">data-controller</code> attribute.</p>

    <div class="stacks-preview">
{% highlight html linenos %}
<div class="s-magic-widget s-magic-widget__awsome" data-controller="s-magic-widget">
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Refer to the documentation of individual components on how to configure a component’s behavior.</p>
