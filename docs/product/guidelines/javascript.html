    {% header h2 | Including the Stacks JavaScript %}

    <p class="stacks-copy">While Stacks is first and foremost a CSS library, it also provides commonly used functionality for some components via JavaScript. This functionality is optional. If you only need the styling parts of Stack, you’re free to ignore the provided JavaScript. The converse is not true: The JavaScript components work under the assumption that the Stacks CSS is available.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Stacks JavaScript is currently included within various Stack Overflow projects automatically. If you’re working on a Stack Overflow project, chances are it’s already available for you! If not, reach out to us and we’ll work on getting it setup.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">To include Stacks JavaScript in other projects, do the following.</p>

    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>Include the file <code class="stacks-code">dist/js/stacks.min.js</code> in your page. For example, if you use the unpkg CDN, add the tag <code class="stacks-code">&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/@stackoverflow/stacks/dist/js/stacks.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to your HTML. See <a href="{{ "/product/guidelines/using-stacks" | relative_url }}">Using Stacks</a> for more information on Unpkg and installing Stacks via NPM.</li>

        <li>If you need to support Internet Explorer 11, you also have to include a polyfill <code class="stacks-code">dist/js/stacks.polyfills.min.js</code>. This file has to be included before the main JavaScript file.</li>
    </ul>

    {% header h2 | Using the Stacks JavaScript %}

    <p class="stacks-copy">The Stacks JavaScript components are provided as Stimulus controllers. <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> is a library created by <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> (formerly 37Signals).</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Stimulus allows you to add functionality to your markup in a way that is similar to how you add styling to your markup: by modifying HTML attributes.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Just as you style components by adding classes to the <code class="stacks-code">class</code> attribute, with Stacks JavaScript, you’ll give components optional functionality by adding <code class="stacks-code">data-…</code> attributes to the HTML.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">The basic functional unit of Stimulus, and of a Stacks JavaScript component, is a <b>controller</b>. Controllers are identified by their name, and all Stacks-provided controller names are prefixed with <code class="stacks-code">s-…</code>, just like component CSS classes. You give functionality to an HTML element by setting its <code class="stacks-code">data-controller</code> attribute.</p>

    <div class="stacks-preview _preview-none mb16">
{% highlight html linenos %}
<div class="s-magic-widget s-magic-widget__awesome" data-controller="s-magic-widget"></div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Refer to the documentation of individual components on how to configure a component’s behavior.</p>
