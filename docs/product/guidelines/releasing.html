<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "Create and publish a new version" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Stacks is delivered via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stackoverflow/stacks">NPM</a>, which offers some tools for creating new versions.</p>
    <ol class="stacks-list">
        <li>Open the Stacks repository in your Terminal to build the CSS and JavaScript by running <code class="stacks-code">grunt build</code>.</li>
        <li>Now run <code class="stacks-code">npm version v[x.x.x]</code>. This will update our <code class="stacks-code">package.json</code> files while creating a tag. You can see which version Stacks is at currently by visiting our <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/releases">releases</a>. Our release pattern adheres to the <a href="https://semver.org">semantic versioning</a> spec.</li>
        <li>Now that you’ve created a new version, we’ll need to push the newly-created commit with the version bump. We’ll want to push the tag associated with the version to GitHub so it appears on our releases page. <code class="stacks-code">git push --tags</code>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/releases/new">Draft the release notes</a> on GitHub by choosing the tag you just pushed. Be sure to include a body in the release that describes <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/releases/tag/v0.26.0">what changed</a>.</li>
        <li>Actually publish the release to NPM. <code class="stacks-code">npm publish</code>. This will take you through the publishing workflow if you haven’t already logged in to NPM.</li>
        <li>Once all this is completed, you can safely merge <code class="stacks-code">develop</code> into <code class="stacks-code">master</code>. This deploys our site to <a href="https://stackoverflow.design">https://stackoverflow.design</a> and makes sure our documentation matches the newly-released version.</li>
    </ol>

<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header "h2", "Ship the new version to Stack Overflow" %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">In order for the new version of Stacks to be usable on Core and Careers, you’ll need to ship to both.</p>

    <p class="stacks-copy">Within Core and Careers, run the <code class="stacks-code">update-stacks.bat</code> script within <code class="stacks-code">Tools/</code>. This will copy the files from the latest version of the Stacks repo. You’ll need to do this for both Core and Careers. The script will create a new branch, create a single commit with the updates from Stacks, push the new branch to the repo, and open your browser on the &ldquo;new pull request&rdquo; page.</p>
