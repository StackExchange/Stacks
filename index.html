<p>This is going to be intro page for our UI Kit documentation...</p>
<p>Currently we have 1 content page so far which is Buttons.</p>
<p>These pages are static HTML files and because of that it's not super easy to make changes in content... If you take a look at that buttons.html file you gonna see it's normal page. But it would be perfect if content pages could be simply, well, content and nothing more. So basically only what we have inside <code>&lt;main id="uikit-content"&gt;...&lt;/main&gt;</code>. And everything else, including navigation, would be in some template file... But that's just proposal - if you have any other idea, we're open.</p>
<p>Speaking of navigation - would be awesome to make it generated automatically including "current" classes.</p>
<p>Another thing... Using less.js for compiling less files is kinda painfull because we have tons of less files. And it takes a lot of time to compile it, everytime you refresh the page... Would be cool to have some server-side precompiling or some other magic :).</p>
<p>To be clear, <em>_less</em> folder is our library of less files with all stuff we use in core. This folder is the one we are going to sync with core repo at some point... And <em>stackoverflow</em> folder is folder with all.less &amp; sobase.less files which are needed to make it all running (unfortunately... because it shouldn't work this way but that's another topic).</p>
<p>We don't need any CMS or big templating engine - we can code some stuff so that won't be a problem for us. We are only looking for some automatization whole process of creating those pages.</p>
