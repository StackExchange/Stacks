// DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
//
// Usage of these options is similar to what's described in configuration-dynamic.less, but the options
// in this file also apply to the "static" part of Stacks. In particular this means that these options cannot
// be different per-site in the Q&A project, because the static part is a shared CSS file across all Q&A sites.

// OPTIONS
// -------
//
// #stacks-config-static { @css-reset: normalize; }
//
//      `normalize` is the default, which will include normalize.css (the Nicolas Gallagher reset). Other
//      legal options are `meyer` for the Eric Meyer reset, and `none` if no CSS reset should be compiled in.
//
//
// #stacks-config-static { @breakpoints: 1264px, 980px, 640px; }
//
//      @breakpoints is a list of values "optional_selector1, large_breakpoint1, medium_breakpoint1, small_breakpoint1, optional_selector2, ..."
//
//      Example:
//
//          @breakpoints:
//              1264px, 980px, 640px,
//              'html.smaller_breakpoints', 1164px, 880px, 540px,
//              'html.even_smaller_breakpoints', 200px, 100px, 50px;
//
//      This will generate the responsive atomic classes for each group of breakpoints. If a breakpoint group is preceded by a string,
//      that string will be prepended to the selector, so the breakpoints can be different based on a root element class. This also allows
//      you to completely disable the responsive atomic class unless a modifier class is present somewhere, by not providing a
//      breakpoint group that has no selector. Note that it doesn't make sense to have more than one group that leaves the selector off.
//      Also note that if you have a group *with* a selector and a group *without* one, or selectors that aren't mutually exclusive otherwise,
//      you may end up with undesireable effects. For example:
//
//          <html class="smaller_breakpoints"
//              ...
//              <div class="lg:d-none"></div>
//              ...
//          </html>
//
//      With the example @breakpoints setting from above, this <div> will be hidden below 1264px even though the smaller_breakpoints class
//      is on the root element, because the selector-free breakpoint group still applies.
//
//      Any selector, if given, MUST select the root (html) element.
//
// Previously, the CSS reset option was a simple global variable. For backwards compatibility, we'll handle it correctly for a bit.
