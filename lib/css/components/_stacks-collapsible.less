// see http://stackoverflow.com/a/43965099 for how this works:

// Notes on the clip-path stuff: What we would really like is overflow: hidden during the transition,
// but not when the element is expanded. Unfortunately, although the CSS spec provides for it, there's
// no browser support yet for transitioning non-interpolatable properties, and therefore we cannot say
// "change overflow to visible *after* the transition".
//
// So we use clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 100%, 0% 100%), which is essentially the same
// as overflow: hidden, but unlike overflow, clip-path is interpolatable -- but only if the opposite state
// is also a polygon, and has the same vertice count. So our version of overflow: visible is a rectangle
// of 2x2 million pixels, which should be enough for everybody (TM).
//
// At the time of writing, clip-path works in Chrome, Firefox Beta, and Safari (with vendor prefix).
//
// In browsers that do not support this yet, we have to have another way to prevent the expandable content
// from being visible below the bottom edge during the transition, and the best I could come up with is
// transitioning to scaleY(0) with a timing function that's faster than the height-reducing transitions.
// This does kinda look like a deliberate effect, even more so if we also transition to transparency
// (which we therefore do), so I feel it's an okay fallback.
//
// We still set overflow to hidden in the collapsed state (which also applies to the collapsing transition),
// we just can't do that for the expanding transition.
//
// A major drawback of clip-path is that even though the content is clipped (not visible), it will still
// contribute to the document height. This caused a jumping around of the scrollbar (and possibly even
// of the viewport) when the expandable was at the bottom of the page, because once the negative bottom
// margin of the -expandable-group exceeds the actual height, any additional pixels were added on to the
// bottom. The fix is to set the -expandable-group's flex alignment to flex-start, which forces the
// (no longer visible) element itself to remain at the top, thereby forcing the excess pixels to be added
// above the top, not below the bottom. And because extending content above the document top will not do
// anything to the document height, there is no jumping during the transition.

// Per the answer referenced above, the component can only guarantee smooth transitions if above a minimum
// height and can only guarantee the element will be hidden is below a maximimum height.
// The minimum height has been set at 10px because that's below the height of a single line of text in an s-description.
